# ContentOS Current State
*Last Updated: September 9, 2025*

## What Works ✅
- Phase generation (30 posts at once)
- Dual language output (English + Swedish)
- Basic UI deployed on Vercel
- Can generate mixed templates

## What We're NOT Building ❌
- Phase memory system (not needed)
- Analytics integration (premature)
- Complex persona management (overkill)
- Any features beyond basic generation

## Next Actions
1. Generate Phase 1 content TODAY
2. Start posting tomorrow
3. Build a tool that makes money
4. Stop adding features to ContentOS

## Remember
ContentOS is a means to an end (posting content).
It's not the product. It's not the business.
Stop perfecting it. Use it and move on.
