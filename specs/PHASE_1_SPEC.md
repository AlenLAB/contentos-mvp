# Phase 1 Generation Spec
*Ready to generate TODAY - Stop planning, start posting*

## Phase Details
**Title**: "Building Without Code - The Pivot"
**Duration**: 30 days
**Posts per day**: 1
**Start Date**: September 10, 2025

## Generation Prompt for Claude

Generate 30 posts for my pivot to AI. Context:
- I'm 24, Swedish, living at home
- 8 months learning AI, 0 revenue
- Building BASIO (AI tools for e-commerce)
- Starting from 50 LinkedIn followers, 0 on X

### LinkedIn Posts (Swedish)
For each day, create Swedish content that:
- Positions me as AI implementation expert
- Shows ROI/efficiency gains
- Speaks to e-commerce owners
- Professional but approachable
- 500-1500 characters

Topics progression:
Week 1: Why I'm pivoting to AI consulting
Week 2: What AI can do for Swedish e-commerce
Week 3: Real implementation examples
Week 4: How we can work together

### X Posts (English)
For each day, create English content that:
- Shows raw building journey
- Admits struggles (no revenue, living at home)
- Teaches what I'm learning
- Builds in public
- Max 280 characters

Topics progression:
Week 1: Starting from zero
Week 2: What I've learned in 8 months
Week 3: Building my first real tool
Week 4: Join me or watch me

### IMPORTANT
Same day = related theme, different angle
LinkedIn: Professional value
X: Personal journey

## After Generation
1. Review quickly (don't over-edit)
2. Start posting tomorrow
3. Build a revenue tool while posts run
4. Stop adding features to ContentOS

## Success = Posted, Not Perfect
The goal is to start posting tomorrow.
Not to build the perfect content system.
